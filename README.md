# Youtube Video Downloader

This is a simple python project to download youtube videos. Main intention is to learn while doing, so dont expect a great app.


## TODO

- #### add a progress bar both for downloanding and combining videos and audios

- #### some weird named videos cause problems with the os path (fix)

- #### add video duration to the gui and some other props maybe

- #### add multi-threading so that program doesnt frooze while downloading
